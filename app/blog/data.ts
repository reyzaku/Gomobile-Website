      intro:
        "Every quarter we compile internal trading data across our SEA markets and compare it against available industry benchmarks. This quarter's numbers were mostly in line with expectations — except for one trend that doesn't show up in the public reports but has significant implications for how we're planning Q3 budgets.",

          heading: "Chart 1: Programmatic share of display is plateauing",
          content:
            "Programmatic's share of total display spend in SEA hit approximately 78% this quarter and has been flat for three consecutive quarters. This isn't a sign of stagnation — it reflects that programmatic has essentially absorbed all the addressable display inventory. The remaining 22% is primarily direct IO deals for premium placements, sponsorships, and inventory that isn't available via DSP for contractual or technical reasons. We're at peak programmatic share for display.",

          heading: "Chart 2: CTV is growing faster in Indonesia than anywhere else in the region",
          content:
            "Indonesia CTV spend grew 84% year-over-year in our portfolio — significantly ahead of Singapore (41%), Philippines (52%), and Vietnam (38%). The driver is smart TV penetration, which is accelerating as device prices fall. The implication: if you're buying CTV in SEA and not over-indexing on Indonesia, you're undersizing the biggest growth market.",

          content:
            "For the first time in our data, social media's share of performance-objective campaign budgets declined quarter-over-quarter across three of four markets. The shift is going primarily to programmatic native and search. This tracks with what we hear anecdotally — iOS signal loss has made social performance campaigns measurably less efficient for DTC and e-commerce clients, and the budget is following the efficiency.",

          heading: "The uncomfortable trend",
          content:
            "Here's what's not in the public reports: MFA (Made for Advertising) site traffic in SEA is growing. Our pre-bid filter is rejecting a higher volume of MFA-originated bid requests every quarter. These sites are multiplying because the economics work — they generate enough ad revenue from buyers who don't filter pre-bid to stay profitable. The advertisers funding these sites mostly don't know they're doing it. If you're not actively filtering MFA domains either at the DSP level or via your ad verification partner, a meaningful fraction of your budget is subsidising content farms.",
        },
      ],
      conclusion:
        "The headline numbers for SEA digital advertising are healthy. But the distribution of where that spend goes — and the quality of the inventory absorbing it — is increasingly uneven. The gap between programmatic buyers who filter well and those who don't is widening, and it's showing up in cost-per-outcome data. Standard industry benchmarks won't tell you this because they aggregate across both populations.",

      intro:
        "Incrementality testing is the closest thing to ground truth in digital attribution, and it's underused because it has a reputation for being disruptive to campaign delivery. Most teams worry that geo holdouts or PSA tests will tank their pacing metrics and create reporting anomalies they'll have to explain to clients. Having run 40+ incrementality tests across two years without a single significant pacing incident, we think that reputation is mostly unwarranted. Here's the practical playbook.",

          content:
            "Geo holdout tests split your target geography into matched test and control groups, withholding ads from the control group. They're the cleanest test design but require your audience to be geographically addressable. PSA (public service ad) tests replace your ads in the control group with low-value PSA creative, which holds auction participation constant. Geo holdouts are our first choice for any campaign where geographic segmentation is practical. PSA tests work when your audience is defined by behavioural criteria that can't be geographically partitioned.",

        {
          heading: "Matching test and control groups",
          content:
            "The quality of your test depends almost entirely on how well your test and control groups are matched before the test begins. We match on: prior conversion rates (at least 4 weeks of baseline), demographic composition, device mix, and day-of-week delivery patterns. Groups that are well-matched at baseline will give you a clean read on the treatment effect. Groups that aren't matched will produce results that look significant but are driven by pre-existing differences.",

          heading: "Keeping pacing intact",
          content:
            "The pacing concern is real but manageable. If you withhold 20% of your audience as a control group, your campaign will initially under-pace because your audience pool is smaller. The solution is to set your holdout percentage relative to the headroom in your pacing curve — never more than the percentage by which your current delivery is ahead of pace. For always-on campaigns running at 95%+ delivery, you should use a 5-10% holdout maximum. For campaigns with 30%+ delivery headroom, you can safely use larger holdout groups and get more statistical power.",

          heading: "What to do with the results",
          content:
            "An incrementality test result is a point-in-time measurement of a specific channel's contribution under specific conditions. It's valuable for validating attribution model assumptions and making strategic budget allocation decisions, but it should inform rather than override your day-to-day optimisation signals. When test results and attribution models disagree significantly (more than 30% on channel credit), we use the test result as the ground truth and recalibrate the attribution model rather than discarding the test.",
        },
      ],
      conclusion:
        "Incrementality testing isn't a special project — it should be a permanent fixture of your measurement practice. The barrier is mostly operational: the test design, the pacing management, and the result interpretation are learnable skills. The knowledge that comes from 12 months of continuous incrementality testing is significantly more reliable than any attribution model, and it compounds over time as your test history accumulates.",
